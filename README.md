## Environment

Processing 3.3.6<br>
Processing OPENGL Library

## Introduction

This is a off-axis projection practice project.<br>
Off-axis relate to Depth Screen or Mirror interactive effects,just like seeing through the screen.<br>

You can use many kinds of interactive sensors,for example Kinect, RealSence, Camera, to capture user's eye position.

## Notes

* The 'aspect_ratio' should be same as 'size()' aspect ratio.<br>
For example 'aspect_ratio_X=16' 'aspect_ratio_Y=10', than 'width=800' 'height=500'

* There are two major effects, Depth and Mirror.<br>
The different between these two effect is positive and negative view movement.
